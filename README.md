In main there is the routine for Euler's method 
  and is used in the other projects.
  
MATLAB tutorial is a quick run-through 
  of basic functions in MATLAB.
  
The bifurcation project shows the limitations 
  of numerical approximation of autonomous ODEs.
  
The SIR-COVID project allows one to fit a simple 
  one-peak infection curve to the COVID pandemic data 
    and predict a herd immunity.

The gradient_descent project contains an algorithm for 
  conjugate gradient descent method in MATLAB.

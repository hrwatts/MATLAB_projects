On Friday, March 13, 2020, the county of Tuscaloosa, AL recorded its first case of
the infectious disease COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. On April 29,
2020, the first fatality was recorded in the county. Today, over 100 people have
died from COVID-19 in Tuscaloosa. The total recorded cases and deaths are given
for each county in the US at the following web address.

(a) Clean the data for use in MATLAB.

(i) Transpose the cases and deaths counts into a specific .csv file.

(ii) Construct a table of weekly cases and deaths from COVID-19 in
Tuscaloosa.

(iii) Plot the cases and deaths on a bar graph.

(b) Fit an SIR model (p. 276) to the data

(i) Use the maximum weekly deaths as the peak of the infection.

(ii) Plot the infection curve in the same figure as the bar graph.

(iii) Plot the SIR curves together in one figure.

(c) Describe the characteristics of the fitted model.

(i) Determine the expected ‚Äúheard immunity‚Äù proportion ùë†‚àó.

(ii) Determine the contact rate ùëé and the recovery rate ùëò.

(iii) Compare and contrast your calculated model with official estimates
from outside sources.

(d) Complete (a)-(c) for a county of your choosing, e.g., New York, Los Angeles,
or your hometown.

(e) Complete (a)-(c) for a state of your choosing. Use Excel to auto-sum values
in the source provided.

(f) Complete (a)-(c) for the total population of the US.

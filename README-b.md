# Period Doubling and Chaos #

The phenomena of period doubling and chaos may be observed when a numerical
method is used to approximate the solution to an initial value problem for a
nonlinear differential equation.

Discuss the end behavior of the
approximate solutions obtained using Eulerâ€™s method
